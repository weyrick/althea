** MATERIALS **

- when a material is "used" (offensively in melee), IT is checked against being "pounded". 
  but when an material needs to check to receive damage, it checks based on the type of "attack", ie, water, fire,
  acid, crushing, slashing, etc

- material resistance is 0-255, 0 being not resistant at all, 255 being impeneterable or unaffected
  most materials will have resistance in range 0-100
  base resistance check is 10d10
  if resistance of material is >= resistance roll, no damage occurs
  if resistance of material is < resistance roll, 1 point of damage per 3 points of difference occurs

- if the damage level before a check for ANY particular affect is >= that affects highest damage adjective level,
  the damage check will be modified heavily towards the negative end to make the check fail (the material (and thus,
  object) is in effect unusable, unless it's repaired).
  
- damage roll gets applied once to each material component of an object

- resistance modifiers include: distance an object falls, strength of blow, damage of blow, current state of
  objects material (ie, rusted or cracked)
  
# damage adjectives are done by 0-255 list
# they will be concatenated when the material is examined, based on current damage the state tells us
# if there is none listed for a state based on the current damage, it is skipped
# 0, no damage, is "brand new"
# 255, max damage, is broken and unusable

- resistance to time is based on an arbitraty value 0-255. the value is how many hours it takes for a material state
  to increase by one damage point
  
- if there are any other adjectives to be used, besides "time", then time adjective is ommitted.
